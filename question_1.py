#Question 1 (a)
#create a program that calculates the area of a triangle
height=2
base = 15
area = 1/2*base*height
print(f'The area of the triangle is {area}')

#approach 2
height = float(input('Enter the height:'))
base = float(input('Enter the base of the triangle:'))
area = 1/2(base * height)
print(f'the area of the triangle of height{height} and base{base} is {area}')
